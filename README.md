# ppaa-experiments
Compare post-processing aa methods like FXAA

[View!](https://almarklein.github.io/ppaa-experiments/viewer.html)

## Intro

This project started in 2013, in the early days of the Vispy project:
* wiki post: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/wiki/Tech.-Antialiasing
* code: https://github.com/vispy/experimental/tree/master/fsaa

I revived this in 2025, in search for a post-aa filter for [Pygfx](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx).

## Goals

* Compare existing techniques, focussing on pure-post-processing techniques (and only single-pass for now).
* Compare on game-like as well as plot-like images.
* Provide wgsl implemenentations for a few of these algorithms.
* Experiment with algorithms myself.

As for that last point, I observed that most these algorithm use a very simple way to
estimate the orientation of the line, which makes no sense from a scale-space perspective;
these algorithms are very much *not* rotationally invariant, which is probably why the early
versions of FXAA still looked jaggy and were also too blurry. My idea: what if we use proper
scale-space theory (i.e. Gaussian kernels)? I call this Directional Diffusion Anti Aliasing (DDAA).

## Viewer

This repo contains an HTML file to compare different ppaa methods. You can see it online at https://almarklein.github.io/ppaa-experiments/viewer.html

When you've checked out the repo, you can simply open the local html-file in your browser. This is a great tool if you want to e.g. tweak existing methods, add another method, or develop your own method.

## Experiments
This repo contains a script `estimate_line_angles.py` that shows that a Gaussian derivative kernel
has an error in its angle estinate that is more than 2 times smaller than other kernels.
