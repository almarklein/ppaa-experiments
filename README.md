# ppaa-experiments
Compare post-processing aa methods (and ssaa)


## Goals

* Compare existing techniques, focussing on pure-post-processing techniques (and only single-pass for now).
* Compare on game-like as well as plot-like images.
* Provide wgsl implementations for a few of these algorithms.
* Experiment with the algorithms.
* Develop new algorithms.


## Algorithms developed here

* [DDAA](/ddaa.md)
* [SSAA](/ssaa.md)


## Viewer

This repo contains an HTML file to compare different ppaa methods. You can see it online at https://almarklein.github.io/ppaa-experiments/viewer.html

When you've checked out the repo, you can simply open the local html-file in your browser. This is a great tool if you want to e.g. tweak existing methods, add another method, or develop your own method.
